<pre>Hello, and welcome to the /r/cubers weekly competitions! If you're new, please read the entire post before competing!  This is competition todo_comp_num, and will go until todo_deadline.

Thereâ€™s a rotation of 4 events to be held once a month: 5x5, BLD, Skewb, and Pyraminx. You can also request an event to be done! If you want an event in an upcoming competition, write it with your results. One event will be done per week. You must be able to do the event you're requesting.

To compete:

> 1. Scramble your cube, in the event that you are doing, with the scrambles provided. For OLL, do the alg 5 times.

> 1. Using a timer, such as [cstimer] (http://cstimer.net/timer.php) or [qqtimer] (http://www.qqtimer.net/), time your 5 solves and record the results. You are given up to 15 seconds to inspect the cube for each event.

> 1. Post your results down below in a reasonable format. Something like: "3x3: 0.37, 0.62, 0.23, (0.07), (1.13) = 0.41", Where the times in parentheses are the best and worst time, and the average is in bold at the end of the times.

> 1. Please put your times in the order they appear on the post, as it makes result taking faster and more accurate!

> 1. Competition results are taken 9:00PM EDT Sunday nights, so make sure to submit times by then!
